Project: Etch-a-Sketch

- Creating a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs
- create divs using JS
- use another container div to put square in
-- use flexbox oooooop

// ------- I can try adding aditional containers, and then to those adding 16 boxs. For example; I have CONTAINER, to CONTAINER i add COLUMN_1, 
// to COLUMN_1 i add 16 boxs. then to CONTAINER i add COLUMN_2, and to COLUMN_2 i add 16 boxs.
// benefits of this: it means i could add COLUMN_n to CONTAINER, and to each COLUMN i could add n boxs.
// THIS WORKS!!! i now have a dynamic grid

/* 
first things first
- make it such that a div has a box shape, and a border color, no padding/margin
use flexbox to make the box apear as a grid, not as one on each line
possible ideas:
- flex-wrap to have them all fit
- fix their size, so they cant be made smaller or larger
